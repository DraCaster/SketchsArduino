LcdBarGraphX
============

LcdBarGraph is an Arduino library to draw bar graph on a Liquid Chrystal display. This LcdBarGraphX is a fork of the original project to be driven by the "F. Malpartida" version LCD lib (aka. LiquidCrystal_I2C)

See page http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/LcdBarGraph for details.
